# communication_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial on
[Internationalizing Flutter
apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)

This is a FireBase Application which means the backend data is stored in a FireBase database. The Login details to the database are:
Username: comp523groupf@gmail.com
Password: UNCcomp523!!
Here you can access all of the data included in the app and the user data of all your employees etc. At this time there are no charges for any of the programs being used so there is nothing to worry about transferring that over.
*If you need to develop more of the application or want to download to an Android device, follow steps 1-5. Otherwise skip to step 6 to download the application to an iOS device.

This is the repository that holds all of the code to our project. To open our project, click on the green “Code” button near the top right of the screen. Copy the link provided on the HTTPS page.
Finally, open up Visual Studio Code and click on the “View” tab on the top of the page and then the “Command Palette”. In the bar, type “git:clone” and enter then paste the link you copied previously into the text bar. Once again click enter and chose a folder on your computer for the project to be downloaded into.
If prompted, select “open” and “trust the authors” of the project then the project should be open in your Visual Studio Code. 
Downloading Application to a Mobile device:
	Apple (iOS device):
(If you do not have XCode downloaded) Use this link and follow the tutorial on how to download and setup XCode on your computer.
Follow this link to our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/rongill23/audiodash
On this page, you need to click on the green “Code” button near the top right of the screen. On this dropdown, locate “Download ZIP” and click it to start the download process. 
Once downloaded, open and extract the folder from this .ZIP file and double click the “audiodash-main” folder to access our project files.
Locate the “ios” folder and again double click to enter this folder and you should see a “Runner.xcworkspace” folder.  
Double click this folder and it should open up on XCode.
At this point, make sure your mobile device is plugged up to your computer via USB cord. Near the top left of the XCode window should be an Icon with “Runner” next to it. Click on this to chose the device you want to run the application on. 
Then, in the “Signing and Capabilities” tab in XCode, select your personal team in the “Team” scroll down bar. And from there make sure there is a Bundle Identifier typed in the box. If an error occurs, type something unique starting with “com.example.___” (fill in the blank). 
From here, you are ready to build this program on your device! Click on the play icon on the top left area of XCode and it should start to download; this may take some time. 
Finally, follow this path in your settings app, Settings > General > Device Management, and in this click “trust” and your developer name from XCode to be able to use the App.
You should now be able to use our app on your mobile device, if you encountered any trouble along the way, try looking through this tutorial if better explained there: https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/how-to-test-your-flutter-ios-app-on-your-ios-device-75924bfd75a8 
Android Device:
To start the download process of our application to your Android device.
In your device, open up your settings app and search for the “About Phone” page. Inside here, go into the “Software Information” page where you will find “Build Number” tap this seven times until prompted to enter your device password if one is needed. After filling that out, return to the main settings page and find the “Developer options page” where you will enter and enable “USB debugging”.
Plug your phone into your computer and if prompted allow access to the device. In your computer open your command prompt which you can search for in your computer’s start menu. 
Now, you may open the project folder in Android Studio. Type the phrase “flutter devices” into the prompt and click enter to confirm Flutter recognizes your device plugged in.
Finally, type the phrase “flutter run” into the command prompt and click enter to start running the application on your android device.
